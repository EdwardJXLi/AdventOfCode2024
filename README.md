# AdventOfCode 2024 Solutions ðŸŽ„

My personal solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/), written in Python with my custom [aoc_utils](https://github.com/EdwardJXLi/aoc_utils) library.

> Disclaimer: These solutions have been built and tested against my own inputs. I cannot guarantee this works with all possible permutations.

## Running

Git clone (with submodules to pull aoc_utils):

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EdwardJXLi/AdventOfCode2024.git
```

Change directory into a challenge day and run `main.py`:

```bash
$ cd DayX
$ python3 main.py input.txt
...
```

> Note: You will need to download the input `input.txt` into the day's folder.
